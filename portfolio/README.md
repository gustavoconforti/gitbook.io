# Welcome

My name is **ThainÃ¡ Oliveira Vasconcellos**, and I am an IT professional with over 5 years of experience in the field. Once I learned the fundamental concepts of networks, I realized that itâ€™s not enough to make systems communicate on a networkâ€”they need to do so safely. This realization led me to pursue a career in cybersecurity over the past 3 years.&#x20;

I have been focusing on understanding attacks, the footprints they leave behind, and the indicators of compromise. This knowledge helps me determine how to improve system configurations, enhance monitoring, and respond to attacks more effectively. I am looking forward to sharing this research here ðŸ™Œ.
